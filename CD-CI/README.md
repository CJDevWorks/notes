**Continuous delivery**

Lead time and               clock time.
(idea to production)        (lead time - estimation planning) - of interest in CI.

cycle time : Measure of engineering efficiency.

**Continuous delivery**


**Continuous Integration** - (worst part of project everyday?)

- doing things as eagerly as possible rather thana doing it in end. integerating
    - Integrate a early as possible

- Check in trunk daily atleast once.


**Continuous Deployment** (final stage)

**Deployment Pipeline** - Fast automated feedback on the Production readiness for :
-   your application every time there is a change.
-   To Code, infrastructure, or configuration.

**Pre-requisite**
-   comprehensive configuration management.
-   excellent automated testing at all levels.

 Stages in deployment pipeline :

 Commit stage :
 1. version control - source code commit, test build scripts.
 2. Commit Stage : Compile + unit test + assemble + code analysis
    deployable binaries, test reports, metadata
 3. Artifactory repository
