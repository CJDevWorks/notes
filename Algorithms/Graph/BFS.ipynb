For a directed graph, the sum of the sizes of the adjacency lists of all the nodes is E (total number of edges). So, the complexity of BFS is O(|V|) + O(|E|) = O(|V| + |E|).\n",
    "\n",
    "For an undirected graph, each edge will appear twice in the adjacency list: for an edge A-B, A would appear in adjacency list of B, and B would appear in adjacency list of A. So, the overall complexity will be O(|V|) + O (2|E|) = O(|V| + |E|).\n",
