    "This is because in DFS we print the nodes as we see them, which means when we print a node, \n",

    "So DFS gives the order in which the nodes enter the Visiting state and not the Visited state. \n",
    "For topological sorting we need to have the order in which the nodes are completely processed, \n",
    "i.e, the order in which the nodes are marked as Visited. Because when a node is marked Visited then all \n",
    "of its child node have already been processed, so they would be towards the right of the child nodes in \n",
    "the topological sort, as it should be (remember that we are going to reverse the order in which\n",
    "the nodes are marked visited, so that the child nodes go towards the right).\n",
