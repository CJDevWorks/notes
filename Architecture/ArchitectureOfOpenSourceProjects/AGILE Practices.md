**Agile Estimation**
-----------------------

Course grain Estimates :

Iteration 0 : Inception
-----------------------------
* Audiance : ???
* When and where - 2-6 weeks
* Define Story and story points :

How to handle scope creek ? Don't change stories.
* Stories are immutable for that iteration (when you start working it.)-
They cause placeholder stories culture to creep it
* Add stories : complexity point increases , so move to other iteration.

* Estimation Story
 - Developer analyses complexity based on time ?  not a great metric
  So guage relative to a previous story. Magnitude scale (1, 2 times ...)
  Complexity in terms of magnitude of other stories.
  1) get more experience.
  2) less moving variables
  3) consistent across projects

Rot-paper-scrissors :) to predict story point together. (To avoid bias)

Project manager converts the story point to time. He changes the load factor base on previous data point. Its statistical analysis.

BA are one step ahead :

For develovers:
- Test required

**METRICS** :

1. Business derived completion criterion :
 - Written by BA.
 - Not on original Story card.
 - IN the process BA has filled all the details
 - Captured in tool

To implement that BDD (on Cucumber)

2. Binary completion criterion: Either completly done or not done.

What Done means ?

 - DEV done : Look at acceptance criterion and declare that story is done
 (Unit testing dev testing, integration with CI/CD)
 - QA Done : Ready for final test BA
 - BA done : Ready to be shipped to client

BReq. : Causes lousy compression algorithm. We need BA to actually decompress to original

(ahead to actual story)
BA story pipeline ====>  Development  === > QA
                            | <--  Bugs --- |
                            | <============ |

Longer sprint:
- provides quicker (tighter) feedback
- Efficient use of pipeline (Qa is late,  BA is forward). Smaller sprint is problem for BA.
Bigger will cause non-agile model longer wait in feedback.
- Trying to done everything in one iteration by QA will produce unneccessay stress.

- Within Agile team : Role should be switched so as to use pipeline.
