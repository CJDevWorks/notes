1. Store Data - *Databases*.
2. Speed - *Caches*
3. Query, Search - *Search Indexes*
4. Async message communication between processes - *Stream processing*
5. periodicaly crunching large amount of data - *Batch processing*

Whats Redis(DB)? and Apache Kafka(message queues)? How redis provides message queue features and 
Kafka is providing database like durability?

Memcached as caching layer(Distributed Caching)

Full text search server - Elastic Search and Solr.

- How do you ensure that the data remains correct and complete, even when things go wrong internally?

- How do you provide consistently good performance to clients, even when parts of your system are degraded?
 
- How do you scale to handle an increase in load? 

- What does a good API for the service look like?

Non Software Factors -

including the skills and experience of the people involved, 

legacy system dependencies, 

the timescale for delivery, 

your organizationâ€™s tolerance of different kinds of risk, regulatory constraints, etc.

Reliable System or Fault tolerent system -

- what is it? Is there any metric involved or its absolute? 
System behaves correctly even when things(not any thing) go wrong(performing correct function at **desired level of performance**)
This is different for different systems. 
As per system requirement if the application is apple to meet user expectation in case of known failures then its fault tolerent.

- Whats difference between a fault and failure?
A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, 
whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user. 
It is impossible to reduce the probability of a fault to zero; 
therefore it is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures.

- Can faults be minimized to zero?
NO

How to make more fault tolerent/Reliable system?
1. Increase the rate of faults trigerring it deliberately and observe system performance (testing).
Randomly kill application. eg-Netflix Chaos Monkey.

2. Tolerate faults over preventing faults. In some situation you cant tolerate faults so its better to prevent it.
User accessing not authorized data etc...
