OPTIONS BASICS
What are the different levels of option trading available at Fidelity?
Below are the five levels of option trading, defined by the types of option trades you can place if you have an Option Agreement approved and on file with Fidelity.

The option trades allowed for each of the five option trading levels:

Level 1
Covered call writing of equity options.
Level 2*
Level 1, plus purchases of calls and puts (equity, index, currency and interest rate index), writing of cash covered puts, and purchases of straddles or combinations (equity, index, currency and interest rate index). Note that customers who are approved to trade option spreads in retirement accounts are considered approved for level 2.
Level 3
Levels 1 and 2, plus spreads, covered put writing (selling puts against stock that is held short) and reverse conversions of equity options.
Level 4
Levels 1, 2, and 3, plus uncovered (naked) writing of equity options, uncovered writing of straddles or combinations on equities, and convertible hedging.
Level 5
Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, plus uncovered writing of index options, uncovered writing of straddles or combinations on indexes, covered index options, and collars and conversions of index options.
* Retirement accounts can be approved to trade spreads. A new option application and a Spreads Agreement must be submitted at the same time and approved prior to placing any spread transaction.

Why would I buy options instead of buying the underlying security?
You might buy an option instead of the underlying security in order to obtain leverage, since you can control a larger amount of shares of the underlying security with a smaller investment. This gives you the potential for a higher-percentage return than if you were to buy the stock outright. However, with possibility also comes higher risk. If you buy options instead of the underlying security, your options can expire worthless—but if you buy the stock, you still own the shares.

Top
Am I obligated to buy or sell an option's underlying security?
The owner of an option contract is not obligated to buy or sell the underlying security. However, the seller of an option, if assigned, is obligated to buy or sell the security at the strike price.

Top
What requirements must I meet in order to trade options at Fidelity?

A brokerage account
An option agreement on file with the appropriate option level for the trade you're attempting to place
A margin agreement on file (depending on the type of trade)
Sufficient buying power in your account to cover the margin requirement for the trade.

What is a multi-leg option?
Multi-leg options are two or more option transactions, or "legs," bought and/or sold simultaneously in order to achieve a certain investment goal. Typically, multi-leg options are traded according to a particular multi-leg option trading strategy.

Top
Why should I use the multi -leg option trading ticket and not the single leg option trading ticket?
When placing a multi-leg option trade, use the multi-leg option trading ticket because:

You can enter and execute all of the legs of your trade at the same time, based on the pricing you requested. Though you could enter each individual leg on a separate ticket, you risk having one of your legs execute while another one doesn't, or having both execute but at prices you didn't expect.

Top
What are call and put options?
With a call option, the buyer has the right to buy shares of the underlying security at a specific price for a specified time period. With a put option, the buyer has the right to sell shares of the underlying security at a specified price for a specified period of time.

OPTIONS ORDER TYPES, LIMITATIONS, AND CONDITIONS
How are my options paired and what are the requirements?
Your positions, whenever possible, will be paired or grouped as strategies, which can reduce margin requirements and provide you a much easier view of your positions, risk, and performance. Strategies displayed will include those entered into as multi-leg trade orders as well as those paired from positions entered into in separate transactions. Pairings may be different than your originally executed order and may not reflect your actual investment strategy.

Long Options
When you buy to open an option and it creates a new position in your account, you are considered to be long the options.

Requirement: 100% cash upfront

Example:

Buy 10 XYZ Jan 20 Calls at $1; Cost = 10 (number of contracts) x 1 (option price) x 100 (option multiplier) = $1,000

The account consists of: Long 10 XYZ Jan 20 Calls

Spread Requirements*
There are two types of spreads: debit and credit. If you are attempting to open spread positions you must maintain a minimum net worth of $10,000 for 10,000 for equity and indexes equity and indexes in your account. This requirement applies to all eligible account types for spread trading.

*Retirement accounts can be approved to trade spreads.  A new option application and a Spreads Agreement must be submitted at the same time and approved prior to placing any spread transaction.

Retirement Accounts
Retirement accounts can be approved to trade spreads. A new option application and a Spreads Agreement must be submitted at the same time and approved prior to placing any spread transaction. If you are approved for spreads trading in your retirement account you must maintain a minimum Cash Spreads Reserve Requirement of $2,000. This is in addition to any requirement, if applicable, for the spread.

Debit Spread Requirements

Full payment of the debit is required.
Initial spread transactions require an additional cash amount of the minimum cash requirement (also called the cash spread reserve) of $2,000.
The minimum cash requirement is a one-time assessment and must be maintained while you hold spreads in your retirement account.
Example:

In this example, the first spread order placed is:

Buy 10 ABC Jan 50 Calls at $3
Sell 10 ABC Jan 55 Calls at $1
Net debit = $2.00

To calculate the debit spread requirement:

Net debit (2.00) x number of contracts (10) x multiplier (100) = Debit ($2,000)
To calculate the cash reserve debit:

$2,000 (debit) + $2,000 (minimum cash requirement) = $4,000 (total cash reserve debit)
The account consists of:

Cash spread reserve (requirement) = $2,000.

Spread:
Long 10 ABC Jan 50 Calls 
Short 10 ABC Jan 55 Calls

Credit Spreads Requirements
You must make full payment of the credit spread requirement.

Initial spread transactions require you to meet the minimum cash requirement, also called the cash spread reserve, of $2,000.

The minimum equity requirement is a one-time assessment and must be maintained while you hold spreads in your retirement account.
Important: Credit spread requirements can be met by the minimum cash reserve up to $2,000. If the spread requirements are greater than $2,000 you must have the available cash to meet the debit or credit spread requirement.

Example 1:
In this example, the customer is placing his or her first credit spread order.

Sell 15 XYZ Mar 65 Puts at $2.00
Buy 15 XYZ Mar 60 Puts at $1.00 
Net Credit $1.00
To calculate the spread requirement:

Total spread requirement ($6,000) = $7,500 (Difference between the strike prices x number of contracts x multiplier) – $1,500 (cash received)

Details:
Difference between the strike prices ($5) x number of contracts (15) x multiplier (100) = $7,500
Net credit ($1) x number of contracts (15) x multiplier (100) = $1,500
To calculate the cash reserve debit:
The total spread requirement of $6,000 is greater than the $2,000 minimum cash requirement.
Therefore, the cash reserve debit is $6,000.
The account consists of:

Cash spread reserve (requirement) = $7,500 ($6,000 cash reserve debit plus $1,500 credit received)

Spread:
Short 10 XYZ Mar 65 Puts
Long 10 XYZ Mar 60 Puts
Example 2:
In this example, this is the first credit spread order placed.

Sell 5 XYZ Mar 65 Calls at $2.50
Buy 5 XYZ Mar 60 Calls at $1.50 
Net Credit $1.00
To calculate the spread requirement:

Total spread requirement ($2,000) = $2,500 (Difference between the strike prices x number of contracts x multiplier) - $500 (credit received)

Details:
Total spread requirement ($2,500) = Difference between the strike prices ($5) x number of contracts (5) x multiplier (100)
Credit received ($500) = Net credit ($1) x number of contracts (5) x multiplier (100)
To calculate the cash reserve debit:
The net spread requirement of $2,000 is equal to the $2,000 minimum cash requirement.
Therefore, the cash reserve debit is $2,500 ($2,500 spread requirement - $500 credit received).
The account consists of:

Cash spread reserve (requirement) = $2,500 ($2,000 cash reserve debit plus $500 credit received)

Spread:
Sell 5 XYZ Mar 50 Calls
Buy 5 XYZ Mar 55 Calls
Non-Retirement Accounts

Debit Spreads Requirement
Full payment of the debit is required.

Example:
Buy 10 XYZ 20 Calls at $2 
Sell 10 XYZ 25 Calls at $.50 
Net Debit = $1.50 or (Long Premium $2 – Short Premium $.50) x 10 (contracts) x 100 (multiplier) = $1,500

The account consists of: 
Long 10 XYZ Jan 20 Calls
Short 10 XYZ Jan 25 Calls

Credit Spreads Requirements
Whichever is lower:

The greater of the two naked requirements on the short call, as calculated for naked equity calls
The greater of the difference in the strike prices or the difference in the premiums
Example:

Underlying price $55
Sell 10 XYZ Feb 50 Put at $1.50 
Buy 10 XYZ Feb 45 at $.50 Put
Net Credit = ($1.50 (short premium) - $.50 (long premium)) x 10 (contracts) x 100 (multiplier) = $1,000

Requirement = $5, 000

Which is the lower of:

Difference between Strike prices:
50 (strike price) - 45 (strike price) x 10 (contracts) x 100 (multiplier) = $5,000

or

The higher of the Naked Requirement:

(($55 (underlying stock) x .25) - 5 (out of the money) + 1.50 (premium)) x 100 (multiplier) x 10 (contracts) = $10,250
(50 (strike price) x .15 + $1.50 (premium)) x 100 (multiplier) x 10 (contracts) = $9,000
Naked Requirements
An option is considered naked when you sell an option without owning the underlying asset or having the cash to cover the exercisable value.

If you are attempting to short naked options you must have a margin account and must maintain a minimum balance of $20,000 for equity and $50,000 for indexes in your account.

Equity calls: The higher of the following requirements:
25% of the underlying stock value, minus the out-of-the-money amount, plus the premium
15% of the underlying stock value, plus the premium
Equity puts: The higher of the following requirements:

25% of the underlying stock value, minus the out-of-the-money amount, plus the premium
Premium plus 15% of the strike price (for both in-the-money and out-of-the-money options)
Index calls: The higher of the following requirements:

Broad-based:
20% of the underlying value, minus the out-of-the-money amount, plus the premium
15% of the underlying value, plus the premium
Narrow-based:
25% of the underlying value, minus the out-of-the-money amount, plus the premium
15% of the strike price, plus the premium
For short straddles or strangles, the requirement is the greater of the two naked option requirements, plus the premium of the other option, in cash or available to borrow.

Requirements are subject to change.
