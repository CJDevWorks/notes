What order types are available for fixed income trades?
You can enter the following order types for fixed income trades:

Market (secondary market and new issue buys, secondary market sells)
Limit Coupon (new Municipal Reset buys or on hold orders of existing positions): The limit coupon represents the minimum coupon that you are willing to accept at the next auction when the rate is reset. On a new buy, if the result of the auction is a coupon level above the level you stipulated, then your order will be filled. It's a similar result for on holder orders. If the result of the auction is a coupon level above the one you stipulated, then you would keep your position, and it would pay at the rate set at the auction. Note: At the present time, only Municipal Reset buy orders can be submitted online. To submit a sell or hold order, please contact a Fidelity representative at 800-544-6666.
Limit Price This is the highest price at which you are willing to buy or the lowest price at which you are willing to sell securities.
Limit Yield This represents the lowest yield at which you are willing to buy or the highest yield at which you are willing to sell securities.

What is a Request for Bid Quote?
When you need to sell a fixed income security immediately, but there are no dealer bid quotes displayed, or you wish to sell a smaller quantity than the current minimum, you may enter a request for bid quote. In this process:

You request bids from dealers for a specific quantity.
Dealer response(s), including bid price(s), are emailed to you and posted in the Communications Center found on the Portfolio Summary page.
You can choose to sell at the dealer's price or let the bid response expire.
Bid quote requests are valid only until the close of the trading day.
The bid quote request process typically engages dealers who are willing to bid on illiquid or higher risk securities. This finite pool of dealers may discontinue the practice of bidding if they believe Fidelity's customers are using this service for pricing purposes only. That's why Fidelity does not allow you to enter numerous bid requests for the same bond over the course of the day.

If you have questions, please call 800-544-5372.

What is the yield on a fixed income security?
Ask yield reflects the lowest of the yield to maturity, yield to call, or the yield to pre-refunded date. If a bond is quoted to call date or pre-refunded date, and interest rates have declined, the bond's issuer is likely to call the bond on the next call date or pre-refunded date, if it is favorable to the issuer's interests. If a bond is called or pre-refunded the bond holder's interest payments cease and the principal is returned as of call date or pre-refunded date. If the bond holder seeks to reinvest this principal in a similar bond issue, he will likely have to accept a lower yield (and lower interest payments) consistent with prevailing interest rates. Not all bonds are callable.
The prices and yields shown on Fidelity's Fixed Income Secondary Offering tables are posted prior to the assessment of the Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (FBS) concession. The FBS concession will be applied for customer review prior to placement of the order.

How do I enter a limit price or limit yield for a bond order?
You can enter:

A yield limit with up to three decimal places (e.g., 4.123)
A price limit with up to six decimal places (e.g., 4.123456)

Are limit orders guaranteed?
Although a limit order enables you to specify a price limit, it does not guarantee that your order will be executed. You should monitor your orders on the Order Status page or Indications of Interest Order Status Page.

Top
What limitations and restrictions can I place on fixed income orders?
All bond orders are assumed to be fill or kill .
Only the day time-in-force limitation is permitted.
Conditions are not applicable.
Top
Am I guaranteed an allocation of new issue securities?
Entering an order makes you eligible for but does not guarantee an allocation of bonds. If the offering is oversubscribed (more bonds were requested than available for purchase) and you did not withdraw your order, you may receive a portion of the bonds you requested, or none at all. Fidelity allocates bonds as fairly and equitably as possible.

Top
Will I have the opportunity to change or void a trade before executing it?
Your order will not be sent to Fidelity if you leave the Verification page before you click Place Order, or if you click Cancel.

Top
When is my order submitted to Fidelity?
When you click Place Order on the Verification page, you are agreeing that the order information is correct, and you are authorizing Fidelity to execute the order on your behalf.
