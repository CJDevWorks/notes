Capital Market Interview Questions: Market Risk



Q : What is derivative - Sandeep Kanao

Wikipedia's definition :

A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying assets. In practice, it is a contract between two parties that specifies conditions (especially the dates, resulting values of the underlying variables, and notional amounts) under which payments are to be made between the parties.[1][2]


Q : What are different types of derivatives

The most common types of derivatives are: forwards, futures, options, and swaps. The most common underlying assets include: commodities, stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies.

Q : What is discount factor

The present value P of an amount to be paid N years in the future (F) at a discount rate of i per annum is P = F(1 + i)-n. The factor (1 + i)-n is the Discount Factor for the present value of $1 received at stated future date.

Example :

Find the present value for $1,000,000 paid 5 years in the future at a discount rate of 7½% per annum. It will be @$696,559


Q : What is market data

Wikipedia's definition :

Market data is quote and trade-related data associated with equity, fixed-income,financial derivatives, currency, and other investment instruments. Market data is numerical price data, reported from trading venues, such as stock exchanges. The price data is attached to a ticker symbol and additional data about the trade.

Q : What is option

An option is a derivative financial instrument that establishes a contract between two parties concerning the buying or selling of an asset at a reference price.

An option which conveys the right to buy something is called a call option; an option which conveys the right to sell is called a put option. The reference price at which the underlying may be traded is called the strike price or exercise price.

Q : What is future option

Future is a trade whose settlement is going to take place in the future. These contracts are traded on the stock exchanges and it can change many hands before final settlement is made. The advantage of a future is that it eliminates counterparty risk.

Q: What is forward option

In forward option a buyer and a seller enter into a contract at a specified quantity of an asset at a specified price on a specified date.

Q : What is basis

The difference between the spot price and the future price

Q : How is the trading done on the exchange?

Buying of futures is margin based. You pay an up front margin and take a position in the stock of your choice. Your daily losses/ gains relative to the future price will be monitored and you will have to pay a mark to market margin. On the final day settlement is made in cash and is the difference between the futures price and the spot price prevailing at that time.
For example, if the future price is Rs 300 and the spot price is Rs 330, then you will make a cash profit of Rs 30. In case the spot price is Rs 290, you make a cash loss of Rs 10. Thus futures market is a cash market.


Q: How does the mark to market mechanism work?

Mark to market is a mechanism devised by the stock exchange to minimise risk.

In case you start making losses in your position, exchange collects money to the extent of the losses up front. For example, if you buy futures at Rs 300 and its price falls to Rs 295 then you have to pay a mark to market margin of Rs 5. This is over and above the margin money that you pay to take a position in the future.


Q : But I hear a lot of jargons about options? What are all these jargons? - Sandeep Kanao

There are some basic terminologies used in options. These are universal terminologies and mean the same everywhere.
a. Option holder : The buyer of the option who gets the right
b. Option writer : The seller of the option who carries the obligation
c. Premium: The consideration paid by the buyer for the right
d. Exercise price: The price at which the option holder has the right to buy or sell. It is also called as the strike price.
e. Call option: The option that gives the holder a right to buy
f. Put option : The option that gives the holder a right to sell
g. Tenure: The period for which the option is issued
h. Expiration date: The date on which the option is to be settled
i. American option: These are options that can be exercised at any point till the expiration date
j. European option: These are options that can be exercised only on the expiration date
k. Covered option: An option that an option writer sells when he has the underlying shares with him.
l. Naked option: An option that an option writer sells when he does not have the underlying shares with him
m. In the money: An option is in the money if the option holder is making a profit if the option was exercised immediately
n. Out of money: An option is in the money if the option holder is making a loss if the option was exercised immediately
o. At the money: An option is in the money if the option holder evens out if the option was exercised immediately

Q : How is the premium of an option calculated?

In practice, it is the market that decides the premium at which an option is traded.
There are mathematical models, which are used to calculate the premium of an option.

There are more advanced probabilistic models like the Black Scholes model and the Binomial Pricing model that calculates the options. One need not go deep into those and it would suffice to say that option calculators are readily available.

Q : I keep reading about option Greeks? What are they? They actually sound like Greek and Latin to me.

There are something called as option Greeks but they are nothing to be scared of. The option Greeks help in tracking the volatility of option prices.
The option Greeks are
a. Delta: Delta measures the change in option price (the premium) to the change in underlying. A delta of 0.5 means if the underlying changes by 100 % the option price changes by 50 %.
b. Theta: It measures the change in option price to change in time
c. Rho: It is the change in option price to change in interest rate
d. Vega: It is the change in option price to change in variance of the underlying stock
e. Gamma: It is the change in delta to the change in the underlying. It is a double derivative (the mathematical one) of the option price with respect to underlying. It gives the rate of change of delta.

These are just technical tools used by the market players to analyze options and the movement of the option prices.

Q : How can I arbitrage and make money in derivatives?

Arbitrage is making money on price differentials in different markets. For example, future is nothing but the future value of the spot price. This future value is obtained by factoring the interest rate.

But if there are differences in the money market and the interest rates change then the future price should correct itself to factor the change in interest. But if there is no factoring of this change then it presents an opportunity to makemoney- an arbitrage opportunity.

Q : What are the other strategies using derivatives?

The other strategies are also various permutations of multiple puts, calls and futures. They are also called by exotic names , but if one were to observe them closely, they are relatively simple instruments.

Some of these instruments are:
Butter fly spread: It is the strategy of simultaneous buying of put and call
Calendar Spread - An option strategy in which a short-term option is sold and a longer-term option is bought both having the same striking price. Either puts or calls may be used.
Double option – An option that gives the buyer the right to buy and/or sell a futures contract, at a premium, at the strike price
Straddle – The simultaneous purchase and sale of option of the samespecification to different periods.
Tandem Options – A sequence of options of the same type, with variable strike price and period.
Bermuda Option – Like the location of the Bermudas, this option is located somewhere between a European style option which can be exercised only at maturity and an American style option which can be exercised any time theoption holder chooses. This option can be exercisable only on predetermined
dates

Q : What is Backwardation

The price differential between spot and back months when the nearby dates are at a premium. It is the opposite of ‘contango.’


Q: What is Butterfly spread

The placing of two inter-delivery spreads in opposite directions with the centre delivery month common to both. The perfect butterfly spread would require no net premium paid.

Q: What is Calendar Spread

An option strategy in which a short-term option is sold and a longer-term option is bought both having the same striking price. Either puts or calls may be used.

Q : What is Call option

An option that gives the buyer right to buy a futures contract at a premium, at the strike price.

Q: What is Contango

The price differential between spot and back months when the marking dates are at a discount. It is the opposite of ‘backwardation.’

Q: What is In-the money option

An option with intrinsic value. A call option is in-themoneyif its strike price is below the current price of the underlying futures contract and a put option is in-the-money if it is above the underlying.


Q. : What is Kerb trading

Trading by telephone or by other means that takes place after the official market has closed. Originally it took place in the street on the kerb outside the market.

Q. : What is Margin call

A demand from a clearing house to a clearing member or from a broker to a customer to bring deposits up to a required minimum level to guarantee performance at ruling prices.

Q. What is Mark to market

A process of valuing an open position on a futures market against the ruling price of the contract at that time, in order to determine the

Q : What is Out-of-the money option

An option with no intrinsic value. A call option is out-of-the money if its strike price is above the underlying and a put option is so if its below the underlying.

Q. What is option premium


Q. What is Spread - Sandeep Kanao


The difference between the bid and asked prices in any market.


Technical – Financial
• I have a call option maturing in one year with 0.5 delta. what's the
probability it will expire in the money?
o 0.5 : Δ = Φ (m + σ√(T)/2), which is close to actual probability Φ (m)
of expiring ITM. The true probability, the dual delta, is the derivative
w.r.t. strike price K.
• How could you quickly decide when to exercise a Bermudan receiver
swaption?
o Consider for each exercise date the effective rate over the tenor of
the swaption taking into account the prevailing rate up to the
exercise date and the strike rate. Would it be advantageous to wait
or exercise?
• Walk me through a DCF.
• What is the Capital Asset Pricing Model and how is it derived?
• What are the inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model?
• If interest rates rise, what happens to bond prices, and why?
• What is duration/Macaulry duration/Modified duration?
• If the yen/dollar exchange rate is 100yen/$ today and the one year forward
rate is 105yen/$, what does this imply?
• Would a price of a call option go up or down when the maturity of the
option is longer?
• Which is higher – the cost of debt or the cost of equity?
• What’s leveraged finance?
• What is a PE ratio? What does a relatively high PE ratio mean to the
market, and how does that differ to what it means for a trader?
Technical – Math
• What is the limit of ((a^x + b^x)/2)^(1/x) as x goes to 0?
o sqrt(a*b). Look at the log of the formula and use L'Hopital's rule.
• If you had 5,623 participants in a tournament, how many games would
need to be played to determine the winner
o log(5623)/log(2)
• There's a 60% chance it will rain on Saturday AND Sunday. What is the
probability that there will be rain on the weekend?
o 84%
• Imagine an analog clock set to 12 o'clock. Note that the hour and minute
hands overlap. How many times each day do both the hour and minute
hands overlap? How would you determine the exact times of the day that
this occurs?
o After 12 o'clock, the minute hand races ahead of the hour hand. By
the time the minute hand has gone all the way round the clock and
is back at 12, one hour later (i.e., at 1 o'clock), the hour hand has
moved to indicate 1. Five minutes later, the minute hand reaches 1
and is almost on top of the hour hand, but not quite, since by then
the hour hand has moved ahead a tiny amount more. So the next
time after 12 that the minute hand is directly over the hour hand is a
bit after 1:05. Similarly, the next time it happens is a bit after 2:10.
Then a bit after 3:15, and so on. The eleventh time this happens, a
bit after 11:55, has to be 12 o'clock again, since we know what the
clock looks like at that time. So the two hands are superimposed
exactly 12 times in each 12 hour period.
o To answer the second part of the puzzle, you have to figure out
those little bits of timer you have to keep adding on. Well, after 12
o'clock there are eleven occasions when the two hands match up,
and since the clock hands move at constant speeds, those 11
events are spread equally apart around the clock face, so they are
1/11th of an hour apart. That's 5.454545 minutes apart, so the little
bit you keep adding is in fact 0.454545 minutes. The precise times
of the superpositions are, in hours, 1 + 1/11, 2 + 2/11, 3+ 3/11, all
the way up to 11 + 11/11, which is 12 o'clock again.
• Given a fair coin, what is the expected number of tosses you need to get 2
consecutive heads?
• “Out of 25 horses, pick the fastest 3 horses. In each race, only 5 horses
can run at the same time. What is the minimum number of races
required?”

needed to find a specific number if you are given the hint "higher" or
"lower" for each guess you make.”
Puzzles
• You've got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay
them. The gold bar is segmented into seven connected pieces. You must
give them a piece of gold at the end of every day. If you are only allowed
to make two breaks in the gold bar, how do you pay your worker?
o 4,2,1
• Given a two-sided balance and 9 marbles, 1 of which whose weights is
different from the rest (more or less), how can you identify the odd marble
in the least number of weighings?
o Weigh 3 v. 3. If equal, it’s in the third set of 3. If unequal, remove
one from each side, swap one from each side onto the other side,
and re-weigh. If equal, it’s one that you removed. If unequal and the
balance falls to the same side, it’s one that you left. Otherwise, it’s
one that you swapped.
• Imagine a disk spinning like a record player turntable. Half of the disk is
black and the other is white. Assume you have an unlimited number of
color sensors. How many sensors would you have to place around the
disk to determine the direction the disk is spinning? Where would they be
placed?
o 2 right next to each other
• Imagine a cube, made of 1000 of small cubes so it's 10 by 10 by 10. how
many of these cubes are facing the outside?
o 488 : (10^3 – 8^3)
• You and I are sitting at a round table, playing a game of coin. By turns we
put down a coin on the table until the table is full. The first person who
cannot put down another coin has lost. Do you want to put down the first
or the second coin?
o First coin - it should be put in the middle. Then no matter where the
other person will put his coin, you will put it exactly oppersite - this
means, if the other person can put down a coin, you will be able to
do so as well. Meaning that the first person not being able to put
down a coin will be person number two.
• I have a 3 gallon drum and a 5 gallon drum and I want 4 gallons of water.
How do I do that with only the 3 and 5 gallon drums?
o Fill the 5 gallon jug , pour into the 3 gallon jug. Pour out the 3 gallon
jug and pour the 2 gallons of water in the 5 gallon jug into the 3
gallon jug. Fill up the 5 gallon jug. Pour 1 gallon from the 5 gallon
jug into the 3 gallon jug with 2 gallons of water in it. You end with 4
gallons of water in the 5 gallon jug and a full 3 gallon jug.
• If given a rectangular cake with a rectangular piece removed (any size or
orientation), how would you cut the remainder of the cake into two equal
halves with one straight cut of a knife?
o Find the centers of both the original cake and the removed piece.
Cut the cake along the line connecting these two centers. As this
line cuts the original cake and the removed piece in half, the
remainder is two equal halves.
o Cut the entire cake in half horizontally (i.e. parallel to the table).
This will get you two even halves.
• You have 18 coins, one of which weighs twice as the others. You have
two-side balance scale which you can use only 3 times to identify it. How

8. “Tell me several different ways a farmer could protect himself from wide swings in the price of soybeans”
9. What models do you use to value options, which one is better? (black-scholes or binomial, you need to also understand model assumptions, probability very well)
10. How to replicate an option portfolio to hedge the risk?
11. Some questions are related to currency options, for example: if you want to invest $1000 million yen in Japan, what product will you design to hedge your currency risk and also make a profit. (design swaps, options, or forwards)
12. How to value derivatives on a coupon bearing bond? How does the interest rate affect the price?

14. I was asked how to use multiple assets e.g. (copper and iron) to hedge against the underlying asset (steel) by using a regression. But they also ask what is the disadvantage of using multiple assets, compare to one variable regression. They said the beta obtained from multivariable regression will have a larger standard error, which means the accuracy of beta will be lower, even though we can have a higher R-square.
15. What is the Black Scholes model and what are the inputs?


16. Why doesn't the Black-Scholes model work for valuing warrants? (Ans: Warrants are rights on NEW equity. BS does not account for flotation costs or dilution effect.)

31. "Q: Say I have a bag full of 100 marbles. I pull out a random number of marbles, which can vary equally from 0-100. If you can guess the number of marbles within 10 either way, I will give you a dollar for each marble that I pull out of the bag (e.g., if you guess 30 and I pull out 40, you get $40). Otherwise, you receive nothing. What is the most amount of money you would pay to play this game?" "A: The guess that you make and the amount that you are willing to pay are independent of one another. Because the number can vary equally from 0-100,


you are always best off to guess 90, as that captures the highest possible range of 80-100 marbles. If you guess 90, you will win 20% of the time. Within the range, $90 will be your average winning. 20% of 90 = $18, which is the expected value of playing this game with optimal strategy. $18 is the absolute most you would be willing to pay for this game."
32. You have a client interested in purchasing a 1 week call option (time to maturity = 1 week) on a stock currently trading at $100 with a strike price of $100. You, as the trader, determine that the option premium is $3 / contract. This is a special option where the option represents 1000 shares of the underlying stock. Questions are as follows:
a. Draw the risk profile for a call option at expiration
b. Calculate the premium received from the sale of the option. (Ans = $3000)
c. You are now short 1 call option. What can you do to eliminate this exposure? (Ans = you cannot use Put-Call Parity to create a synthetic call as there are no 1 week put options available; therefore, you need to do a delta hedge)
d. How do you do such a delta hedge in this case? (Ans = borrow B money to buy D stock)
e. What is the initial value of B and D, i.e. what is the hedge ratio? (Ans = start with h = 0.5)
f. You leave for the day and come back tomorrow (day 2) and the stock price has risen to $102. What do you do? (Ans = borrow more money to buy more stock)
g. How much more stock do you buy, i.e. what is your new hedge ratio h?
This goes on (i.e. the stock price goes from $100 to $102 to $98 to....) each day of the week until the call expires. I needed to adjust my delta hedge position every day and calculate the cost of changing my position (no commissions and risk free rate = 0%). At the end of the exercise, I was required to calculate the net profit on the entire position from the initial $3000 premium to all of the costs associated with adjusting my delta hedge every day. The net profit was on the order of $2700. I was then required to explain why I still made money when I was buying stock at high prices (i.e. $102) and selling stock at low prices (i.e. $98). I gave the answer that we actually lost money during all of those delta hedging transactions since we started with $3000 and ended up with only $2700. So, we lost $300 on all those transactions where we bought high and sold low. However, the goal of the transactions is to hedge out your exposure to any price risk in the stock....that was accomplished and we paid $300 to accomplish that...leaving us with $2700 net profit from completing the deal.
He then went one step farther and asked how this type of exercise can be used to prove that option premiums increase with increasing stock volatility. I said that as the volatility rises, then you will lose more money on each delta hedge



transaction (i.e. you will be buying higher and selling lower than the above example). This will make you demand a higher option premium so that your net profit is still the same...approximately.
Anyway, this example took the whole 30 minute interview to complete. Not fun, but I thought I did well....thanks to your class.
33. The question was who benefits from callable bonds, the company or the investor, and therefore who needs to pay a premium on the “option”? The second, which I initiated: what if it’s a callable, convertible bond? In this case, the holder has the “option” to convert, and the company has the “option” to call in the bond, so the actual price of the bond (in addition to the value of the asset itself) would depend on the value of the company’s option vs. the value of the holder’s option.
34. Couple derivative and risk management questions I have encountered (partly because I had a credit derivatives trading background over the past summer) relate to hedging with CDS contracts and how they function, and the VaR concept (what does it mean, how do they affect the strategy of the business). The basic concepts of entering into a derivatives contract, such as what the payments are, what the payments are contingent upon, and the value of the contract. For instance, theoretically, since YTM = treasury + libor spread + credit spread, they asked me specific questions regarding to the value of the credit, etc. Hope this helps.
35. How much would an option be worth with a two dollar strike price? The payoffs equal the number faced up on a 6sided die after it is rolled.
36. Why and when should a company issue a convertible bond?
37. How do you value a convert?
38. Why doesn’t the Black Scholes model apply to valuing warrants?
39. What are the inputs of the BS model?
40. I interviewed with Goldman Sachs in Private Wealth Management and one of the questions was: ”I have some London-based clients who complained about the returns of the assets that were invested in the U.S. because of the weak dollar. What could you have done?” [Answer: hedging with futures for example].
41. Last year in a consulting interview I was told that one of the problems facing a CPG client (similar to Kraft) was an unexpected increase in the price of raw materials, specifically milk and sugar. Among the options available to the company, I identified the use of substitutes, vertical integration into suppliers and use of options or futures to lock in the price of milk and sugar.


42. I did a number of investment banking interviews, so my derivative and risk management questions were minimal, but there definitely were some. I was consistently asked the five variables in the Black-Scholes equation and how I would go about getting them. As a follow up, there were often questions similar to your homework, asking what happened if volatility or some other variable increased/decreased. I also was asked about portfolio theory and what betas mean, including negative betas.
43. What happens when delta is negative and gamma is positive? (Lehman) What is theta? When is it most useful?(SAC) In general it is not only important to know the definitions of the greeks, but also their signs(+/-) and when it is important to hedge using them.
44. What can we do about FX risk - FX hedges such as future and options.
45. I was asked about real options as part of the valuation of some projects in Brazil.


1. What are derivative instruments? A derivative is an instrument whose value is derived from the value of one or more underlying, which can be commodities, precious metals, currency, bonds, stocks, stocks indices, etc. Four most common examples of derivative instruments are Forwards, Futures, Options and Swaps.Back to Top
2. Why Derivatives? There are several risks inherent in financial transactions. Derivatives allow you to manage these risks more efficiently by unbundling the risks and allowing either hedging or taking only one (or more if desired) risk at a time (please see risk management for more details). 
For instance, if we buy a share of TISCO from our broker, we take following risks
1. Price risk that TISCO may go up or down due to company specific reasons (unsystematic risk). 
2. Price risk that TISCO may go up or down due to reasons affecting the sentiments of the whole market (systematic risk). 
3. Liquidity risk, if our position is very large, that we may not be able to cover our position at the prevailing price (called impact cost). 
4. Counterparty (credit) risk on the broker in case he takes money from us but before giving delivery of shares goes bankrupt. 
5. Counterparty (credit) risk on the exchange - in case of default of the broker, we may get partial or full compensation from the exchange. 
6. Cash out-flow risk that we may not able to arrange the full settlement value at the time of delivery, resulting in default, auction and subsequent losses. 
7. Operating risks like errors, omissions, loss of important documents, frauds, forgeries, delays in settlement, loss of dividends & other corporate actions etc. 
 
Once we are long on TISCO we can hedge the systematic risk by going short on index futures. On the other hand, if we do not want to take unsystematic risk on any one share, but wish to take only systematic risk – we can go long on index futures, without buying any individual share. The credit risk, cash outflow risk and operating risks are much easier to manage in this case. Back to Top
3. What are Forward contracts? A forward contract is a customized contract between two parties, where settlement takes place on a specific date in future at a price agreed today. Back to Top
4. What are Futures? Futures are exchange traded contracts to sell or buy financial instruments or physical commodities for Future delivery at an agreed price. There is an agreement to buy or sell a specified quantity of financial instrument/ commodity in a designated Future month at a price agreed upon by the buyer and seller. The contracts have certain standardized specifications.Back to Top
5. What is the difference between Forward contracts and Futures contracts? Futures is a type of forward contract.
1. Standardized Vs Customized Contract - Forward contract is customized while the future is standardized. To be more specific, the terms of a Forward Contracts are individually agreed between two counter-parties, while Futures being traded on exchanges have terms standardized by the exchange. 
2. Counter party risk - In case of Futures, after a trade is confirmed by two members of exchange, the exchange / clearing house itself becomes the counter-party (or guarantees) to every trade. The credit risk, which in case of forward contracts was on the counter-party, gets transferred to exchange / clearing house, reducing the risk to almost nil. 
3. Liquidity - Futures contracts are much more liquid and their price is much more transparent due to standardization and market reporting of volumes and price. 
4. Squaring off - A forward contract can be reversed only with the same counter-party with whom it was entered into. A Futures contract can be reversed with any member of the exchange. Back to Top 
6. Can there be Futures on individual stocks? Such instruments exist in some countries (example Sydney Futures Exchange) but in general are not very popular. Price volatility in individual stocks is much higher than Index. This results in higher risk of clearing corporation and margin requirements. In addition, such instruments suffer from lack of depth and liquidity in trading. In most cases, Futures based on individual stocks often have a physical settlement, resulting in more complex regulatory requirements. It is much more difficult to manipulate an Index than individual stock, resulting in price manipulations. In India, Dr. L.C.Gupta committee has not mentioned Futures on Individual Stocks as a possible derivative contract. Back to Top

7. What is the difference between Commodity and Financial Futures? The basic difference between commodity and financial Futures is the nature of the underlying instrument. In a commodity Futures, the underlying is a commodity which may be Wheat, Cotton, Pepper, Turmeric, corn, oats, soybeans, orange juice, crude oil, natural gas, gold, silver, pork-bellies etc. In a financial instrument, the underlying can be Treasuries, Bonds, Stocks, Stock-Index, Foreign Exchange, Euro-dollar deposits etc. As is evident, a financial Future is fairly standard and there are no quality issues while a commodity instrument, quality of the underlying matters. Back to Top

8. What do you mean by Closing out contracts? A long position in futures, can be closed out by selling futures while a short position in futures can be closed out by buying futures on the exchange. Once position is closed out, only the net difference needs to be settled in cash, without any delivery of underlying. Most contracts are not held to expiry but closed out before that. If held until expiry, some are settled for cash and others for physical delivery. Back to Top

9. Is the settlement mechanism different for Cash and Physical Delivery? In case it is impossible, or impractical, to effect physical delivery, open positions (open long positions always being equal to open short positions) are closed out on the last day of trading at a price determined by the spot "cash" market price of the underlying asset. This price is called "Exchange Delivery Settlement Price" or EDSP. In case of physical settlement short side delivers to the specified location while long side takes delivery from the specified location of the specified quantity / quality of underlying asset. The long side pays the EDSP to clearing house/ corporation which is received by the short side. Back to Top

10. Is there a theoretical way of pricing Index Future?
The theoretical way of pricing any Future is to factor in the current price and holding costs or cost of carry
In general, the Futures Price = Spot Price + Cost of Carry
Cost of carry is the sum of all costs incurred if a similar position is taken in cash market and carried to maturity of the futures contract less any revenue which may result in this period. The costs typically include interest in case of financial futures (also insurance and storage costs in case of commodity futures). The revenue may be dividends in case of index futures. Apart from the theoretical value, the actual value may vary depending on demand and supply of the underlying at present and expectations about the future. These factors play a much more important role in commodities, specially perishable commodities than in financial futures. In general, the Futures price is greater than the spot price. In special cases, when cost of carry is negative, the Futures price may be lower than Spot prices. Back to Top

11. What is the concept of Basis? The difference between spot price and Futures price is known as basis. Although the spot price and Futures prices generally move in line with each other, the basis is not constant. Generally basis will decrease with time. And on expiry, the basis is zero and Futures price equals spot price. Back to Top

12. What is Contango? Under normal market conditions Futures contracts are priced above the spot price. This is known as the Contango Market Back to Top

13. What is Backwardation? It is possible for the Futures price to prevail below the spot price. Such a situation is known as backwardation. This may happen when the cost of carry is negative, or when the underlying asset is in short supply in the cash market but there is an expectation of increased supply in future – example agricultural products.

6. What are various types of derivative instruments traded at
NSE?
There are two types of derivatives instruments traded on NSE; namely
Futures and Options :
Futures : A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to
buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future at a certain price.
All the futures contracts are settled in cash at NSE.
Options : An Option is a contract which gives the right, but not an
obligation, to buy or sell the underlying at a stated date and at a stated
price. While a buyer of an option pays the premium and buys the right
to exercise his option, the writer of an option is the one who receives
the option premium and therefore obliged to sell/buy the asset if the
buyer exercises it on him.
Options are of two types - Calls and Puts options :
“Calls” give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a given
quantity of the underlying asset, at a given price on or before a given
future date.
“Puts” give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to sell a given
quantity of underlying asset at a given price on or before a given future
date. All the options contracts are settled in cash.
Further the Options are classifi ed based on type of exercise. At present
the Exercise style can be European or American.
American Option - American options are options contracts that can be
exercised at any time upto the expiration date. Options on individual
securities available at NSE are American type of options.
European Options - European options are options that can be
exercised only on the expiration date. All index options traded at NSE
are European Options.
Options contracts like futures are Cash settled at NSE.

7. What are various products available for trading in Futures and
Options segment at NSE?
Futures and options contracts are traded on Indices and on Single
stocks.
The derivatives trading at NSE commenced with futures on the Nifty
50 in June 2000. Subsequently, various other products were introduced
and presently futures and options contracts on the following products
are available at NSE:
1. Indices : Nifty 50, CNX IT Index, Bank Nifty Index, CNX Nifty
Junior, CNX 100 , Nifty Midcap 50, Mini Nifty and Long dated
Options contracts on Nifty 50.
2. Single stocks - 228
8. Why Should I trade in derivatives?
Futures trading will be of interest to those who wish to:
1) Invest - take a view on the market and buy or sell accordingly.
2) Price Risk Transfer- Hedging - Hedging is buying and selling
futures contracts to offset the risks of changing underlying
market prices. Thus it helps in reducing the risk associated with
exposures in underlying market by taking a counter- positions in
the futures market. For example, an investor who has purchased a
portfolio of stocks may have a fear of adverse market conditions
in future which may reduce the value of his portfolio. He can
hedge against this risk by shorting the index which is correlated
with his portfolio, say the Nifty 50. In case the markets fall, he
would make a profi t by squaring off his short Nifty 50 position.
This profi t would compensate for the loss he suffers in his
portfolio as a result of the fall in the markets.
3) Leverage- Since the investor is required to pay a small fraction
of the value of the total contract as margins, trading in Futures is
a leveraged activity since the investor is able to control the total
value of the contract with a relatively small amount of margin.
Thus the Leverage enables the traders to make a larger profi t (or
loss) with a comparatively small amount of capital.

Options trading will be of interest to those who wish to :
1) Participate in the market without trading or holding a large
quantity of stock.
2) Protect their portfolio by paying small premium amount.
Benefi ts of trading in Futures and Options :
1) Able to transfer the risk to the person who is willing to accept
them
2) Incentive to make profi ts with minimal amount of risk capital
3) Lower transaction costs
4) Provides liquidity, enables price discovery in underlying
market
5) Derivatives market are lead economic indicators.
9. What are the benefi ts of trading in Index Futures compared to
any other security?
An investor can trade the ‘entire stock market’ by buying index futures
instead of buying individual securities with the effi ciency of a mutual
fund.
The advantages of trading in Index Futures are:
• The contracts are highly liquid
• Index Futures provide higher leverage than any other stocks
• It requires low initial capital requirement
• It has lower risk than buying and holding stocks
• It is just as easy to trade the short side as the long side
• Only have to study one index instead of 100s of stocks


10. How do I start trading in the derivatives market at NSE?
Futures/ Options contracts in both index as well as stocks can be bought
and sold through the trading members of NSE. Some of the trading
members also provide the internet facility to trade in the futures and
options market. You are required to open an account with one of the
trading members and complete the related formalities which include
signing of member-constituent agreement, Know Your Client (KYC)
form and risk disclosure document. The trading member will allot
to you an unique client identifi cation number. To begin trading, you
must deposit cash and/or other collaterals with your trading member
as may be stipulated by him.

11. What is the Expiration Day?
It is the last day on which the contracts expire. Futures and Options
contracts expire on the last Thursday of the expiry month. If the
last Thursday is a trading holiday, the contracts expire on the
previous trading day. For E.g. The January 2008 contracts mature on
January 31, 2008.

12. What is the contract cycle for Equity based products in NSE ?
Futures and Options contracts have a maximum of 3-month
trading cycle -the near month (one), the next month (two) and the
far month (three), except for the Long dated Options contracts.
New contracts are introduced on the trading day following the
expiry of the near month contracts. The new contracts are introduced
for a three month duration. This way, at any point in time, there will
be 3 contracts available for trading in the market (for each security)
i.e., one near month, one mid month and one far month duration
respectively. For example on January 26,2008 there would be
three month contracts i.e. Contracts expiring on January 31,2008,
February 28, 2008 and March 27, 2008. On expiration date i.e January
31,2008, new contracts having maturity of April 24,2008 would be
introduced for trading.

13. What is the concept of In the money, At the money and Out of the
money in respect of Options?
In- the- money options (ITM) - An in-the-money option is an
option that would lead to positive cash fl ow to the holder if it were
exercised immediately. A Call option is said to be in-the-money when
the current price stands at a level higher than the strike price. If the
Spot price is much higher than the strike price, a Call is said to be deep
n-the-money option. In the case of a Put, the put is in-the-money if
the Spot price is below the strike price.
At-the-money-option (ATM) - An at-the money option is an option
that would lead to zero cash fl ow if it were exercised immediately.
An option on the index is said to be “at-the-money” when the current
price equals the strike price.
Out-of-the-money-option (OTM) - An out-of- the-money Option is
an option that would lead to negative cash fl ow if it were exercised
immediately. A Call option is out-of-the-money when the current price
stands at a level which is less than the strike price. If the current price
is much lower than the strike price the call is said to be deep out-of-the
money. In case of a Put, the Put is said to be out-of-money if current
price is above the strike price.

14. Is there any Margin payable?
Yes. Margins are computed and collected on-line, real time on a
portfolio basis at the client level. Members are required to collect the
margin upfront from the client & report the same to the Exchange.

15. How are the contracts settled?
All the Futures and Options contracts are settled in cash on a daily
basis and at the expiry or exercise of the respective contracts as the
case may be. Clients/Trading Members are not required to hold any
stock of the underlying for dealing in the Futures / Options market.
All out of the money and at the money option contracts of the near
month maturity expire worthless on the expiration date.

FEW BASIC STRATEGIES
Have a view on the market?
Example A.
On 01 March an investor feels the market will rise
– Buys 1 contract of March ABC Ltd. Futures at Rs. 260 (market
lot : 300)
09 March
– ABC Ltd. Futures price has risen to Rs. 280
– Sells off the position at Rs. 280. Makes a profi t of Rs.6000
(300*20)
Example B.
On 01 March an investor feels the market will fall
– Sells 1 contract of March ABC Ltd. Futures at Rs. 260 (market
lot : 300)
09 March
– ABC Ltd. Futures price has fallen to Rs. 240
– Squares off the position at Rs. 240
– Makes a profi t of Rs.6000 (300*20)
Example C.
Assumption: Bullish on the market over the short term Possible Action
by you: Buy Nifty calls
Example:
Current Nifty is 3880. You buy one contract (lot size 50) of Nifty near
month calls for Rs.20 each. The strike price is 3900. The premium
paid by you : (Rs.20 * 50) Rs.1000. Given these, your break-even
Nifty level is 3920 (3900+20). If at expiration

Nifty advances to 3974, then
Nifty expiration level 3974
Less Strike Price 3900
Option value 74.00 (3974-3900)
Less Purchase price 20.00
Profi t per Nifty 54.00
Profi t on the contract Rs. 2,700 (Rs. 54* 50)
Note:
1) If Nifty is at or below 3900 at expiration, the call holder would not
fi nd it profi table to exercise the option and would loose the premium,
i.e. Rs.1000. If at expiration, Nifty is between 3900 (the strike price)
and 3920 (breakeven), the holder could exercise the calls and receive
the amount by which the index level exceeds the strike price. This
would offset some of the cost (premium).
2) The holder, depending on the market condition and his perception,
may sell the call even before expiry.
Example D.
Assumption: Bearish on the market over the short term Possible
Action by you: Buy Nifty puts
Example:
Current Nifty is 3880. You buy one contract (lot size 50) of Nifty near
month puts for Rs.17 each. The strike price is 3840. The premium paid
by you will be Rs.850 (17*50). Given these, your break-even Nifty
level is 3823 (i.e. strike price less the premium). If at expiration Nifty
declines to 3786, then
Put Strike Price 3840
Nifty expiration level 3786
Option value 54 (3840-3786)
Less Purchase price 17
Derivatives Trading

Profi t per Nifty 37
Profi t on the contract Rs.1850 (Rs.37* 50)
Note:
1) If Nifty is at or above the strike price 3840 at expiration, the put holder
would not fi nd it profi table to exercise the option and would loose the
premium, i.e. Rs.850. If at expiration, Nifty is between 3840 (the strike
price) and 3823 (breakeven), the holder could exercise the puts and
receive the amount by which the strike price exceeds the index level.
This would offset some of the cost (premium).
2) The holder, depending on the market condition and his perception,
may sell the put even before expiry.
Example E.
Use Put as a portfolio Hedge?
Assumption: You are concerned about a downturn in the short term in
the market and its effect on your portfolio. The portfolio has performed
well and you expect it to continue to appreciate over the long term but
would like to protect existing profi ts or prevent further losses.
Possible Action: Buy Nifty puts.
Example:
You hold a portfolio of 5000 shares of ABC Ltd. Ltd. valued at Rs. 10
Lakhs (@ Rs.200 each share). Beta of ABC Ltd. is 1. Current Nifty
is at 4250. You wish to protect your portfolio from a drop of more
than 10% in value (i.e. Rs. 9,00,000). Nifty near month puts of strike
price 3825 (10% away from 4250 index value) is trading at Rs. 2. To
hedge, you buy 5 puts, i.e. 250 Nifties, equivalent to Rs.10 lakhs*1
(Beta of ABC Ltd) /4250 or Rs. 1130000/4250. The premium paid by
you is Rs.500, (i.e.250 * 2). If at expiration Nifty declines to 3500,
and ABC Ltd. falls to Rs.164.70, then
Put Strike Price 3825
Nifty expiration level 3500
Option value (per Nifty) 325 (3825-3500)
Derivatives Trading
11
Less Purchase price (per Nifty) 2
Profi t per Nifty 323
Profi t on the contract Rs.80,750 (Rs.323* 250)
ABC Ltd. shares value Rs.8,23,500
Profi t on the Nity put contracts Rs.80,750
Total value Rs.9,04,250
Rs. 9,04,250 is approx. 10% lower than the original value of the
portfolio. Without hedging using puts the investor would have lost
more than 10% of the value.
16. What are the Risks associated with trading in Derivatives?
Investors must understand that investment in derivatives has an element
of risk and is generally not an appropriate avenue for someone of
limited resources/ limited investment and / or trading experience and
low risk tolerance. An investor should therefore carefully consider
whether such trading is suitable for him or her in the light of his or
her fi nancial condition. An investor must accept that there can be
no guarantee of profi ts or no exception from losses while executing
orders for purchase and / or sale of derivative contracts, Investors
who trade in derivatives at the Exchange are advised to carefully
read the Model Risk Disclosure Document and the details contained
therein. This document is given by the broker to his clients and must
be read, the implications understood and signed by the investor. The
document clearly states the risks associated with trading in derivatives
and advises investors to bear utmost caution before entering into the
markets.
Example 1.
An investor purchased 100 Nifty Futures @ Rs. 4200 on June 10.
Expiry date is June 26.
Total Investment : Rs. 4,20,000. Initial Margin paid : Rs. 42,000
On June 26, suppose, Nifty index closes at 3,800.
Derivatives Trading
12
Loss to the investor (4200 – 3780) X 100 = Rs. 42,000
The entire initial investment (i.e. Rs. 42,000) is lost by the investor.
Example 2.
An investor purchased 100 ABC Ltd. Futures @ Rs. 2500 on June 10.
Expiry date is June 26.
Total Investment : Rs. 2,50,000. Initial Margin paid : Rs. 37,500
On June 26, suppose, ABC Ltd. shares close at Rs. 2000.
Loss to the investor (2500 – 2000) X 100 = Rs. 50,000
Example 3.
An investor buys 100 Nifty call options at a strike price of Rs. 4000
on June 15. Nifty index is at 4050. Premium paid = Rs. 10,000 (@Rs.
100 per call X 100 calls).
Expiry date of the contract is June 26
On June 26, Nifty index closes at 3900.
The call will expire worthless and the investor losses the entire Rs.
10,000 paid as premium.
Example 4.
An investor buys 100 ABC Ltd. put options at a strike price of
Rs. 400 on June 15. ABC Ltd. share price is at 380. Premium paid =
Rs. 5,000 (@Rs. 50 per put X 100 calls).
Expiry date of the contract is June 26
On June 26, ABC Ltd. shares close at Rs. 410.
The put will expire worthless and the investor losses the entire
Rs. 5,000 paid as premium.
