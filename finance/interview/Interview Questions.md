Technical Interview Questions
Technical interviews for S&T are much less streamlined and predictable than investment banking technical questions. S&T will come with many open ended questions where the “correct” answer is one where there is a view that is supported by reasonable arguments – whether or not XYZ actually goes in that direction is irrelevant (and post-interview, regardless).

Different desks will ask different questions, but the interview will usually include questions relating to that particular trading product.

Having a good grasp of accounting for derivatives, when derivatives are used and what drives asset prices are key to making a good impression.


1. When would you write a call option on Disney stock?
When you expect the price of Disney stock to fall (or stay the same).
Because a call option on a stock is a bet that the value of the stock will
increase, you would be willing to write (sell) a call option on Disney stock
to an investor if you believed Disney stock would not rise. (In this case, the
profit you would make would be equal to the option premium you received
when you sold the option.)
2. Explain how a swap works.
A swap is an exchange of future cash flows. The most popular forms include
foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps. They are used to hedge
volatile rates, such as currency exchange rates or interest rates.

3. Say I hold a put option on Microsoft stock with an exercise price of
$60, the expiration date is today, and Microsoft is trading at $50. About
how much is my put worth, and why?
Your put is worth about $10, because today, you can sell a share of stock for
$60, and buy it for $50. (If the expiration date were in the future, the option
would be more valuable, because the stock could conceivably drop more.)
4. When would a trader seeking profit from a long-term possession of a
future be in the long position?
The trader in the long position is committed to buying a commodity on a
delivery date. She would hold this position if she believes the commodity
price will increase.
5. All else being equal, which would be less valuable: a December put
option on Amazon.com stock or a December put option on Bell Atlantic
stock?
The put option on Bell Atlantic should be less valuable. Amazon.com is a
more volatile stock, and the more volatile the underlying asset, the more
valuable the option.
6. All else being equal, which would be more valuable: a December call
option for eBay or a January call option for eBay?
The January option: The later an option’s expiration date, the more valuable
the option.
7. Why do interest rates matter when figuring the price of options?
Because of the ever-important concept of net present value, all else being
equal, higher interest rates lower the value of call options.
8. If the strike price on a put option is below the current price, is the
option holder at the money, in the money or out of the money?
Because a put option gives the holder the right to sell a security at a certain
price, the fact that the strike (or exercise) price is below the current price
would mean that the option holder would lose money. Translate that
knowledge into option lingo, and you know that the option holder is out of
the money.

9. If the current price of a stock is above the strike price of a call option,
is the option holder at the money, in the money, or out of the money?
Because a call option gives the holder the right to buy a security, the holder
in this scenario is in the money (making money).
10. When would you buy a put option on General Mills stock?
Because buying a put option gives you the option to sell the stock at a certain
price, you would do this if you expect the price of General Mills stock to
fall.
11. What is the main difference between futures contracts and forward
contracts?
The main difference between forward and futures contracts is that futures
contracts are traded on exchanges and forwards are traded over-the-counter.
Because of this distinction, you can only trade specific futures contracts that
are traded on the exchange. Forward contracts are more flexible because
they are privately negotiated, and can represent any assets and can change
settlement dates should both parties agree.

Stock valuation techniques
The most common forms of fundamental analysis involve the traditional
valuation techniques (DCF, multiples analysis) as well as the various
accounting and financial statement analyses that are covered in the Valuation
Techniques chapter. For investment management interviews, you should
have a strong command for these techniques for valuing individual stocks.

Financial ratios
Another important form of stock analysis is Ratio Analysis, which involves
looking at a company’s various financial ratios and how they have changed
over time to spot trends or trouble spots in the company’s operations. A
financial ratio by itself doesn’t necessary tell you very much. More
important is comparing how a company’s financial ratios are changing from
one quarter to the next, and how they compare a company’s financial ratios
with other companies in its industry.
Below are the most common ratios used in finance to analyze companies.
Particularly if you are interviewing for investment management, equity
research or similar finance positions, you may be asked questions about how
to calculate common financial ratios and what they signify.

Questions
1. If you add a risky stock into a portfolio that is already risky, how is
the overall portfolio risk affected?
A. It becomes riskier
B. It becomes less risky
C. Overall risk is unaffected
D. It depends on the stock’s risk relative to that of the portfolio
Answer: D. In modern portfolio theory, if you add a risky stock into a
portfolio that is already risky, the resulting portfolio may be more or less
risky than before.
A portfolio’s overall risk is determined not just by the riskiness of its
individual positions, but also by how those positions are correlated with
each other. For example, a portfolio with two high-tech stocks might at first
glance be considered risky, but if those two stocks tends to move in opposite
directions, then the riskiness of the portfolio overall could be significantly
lower. So the risk effect of adding a new stock to an existing portfolio
depends on how that stock correlates with the other stocks in the portfolio.
2. Put the following portfolios consisting of 2 stocks in order from the
least risky to the most risky and explain why
A. A portfolio of a cable television company stock and an oil company
stock
B. A portfolio of an airline company stock and a cruise ship company
stock
C. A portfolio of an airline company stock and an oil company stock.
Answer: Least risky: C. Then A. B is the most risky.

The least risky portfolio is the one where the two securities have a strong
negative correlation. Stocks with a strong negative correlation tend to move
in the opposite direction under the same circumstances. Therefore, the value
of the portfolio will remain relatively stable over time, making the portfolio
less risky. In this question, since high fuel prices might be good for oil
companies, but bad for airlines who need to buy the fuel, you would expect
that the stocks of companies in these two industries to move in opposite
directions. These two industries have a strong negative correlation and
portfolio C is the least risky.
Portfolio B is the most risky because the stocks of airline companies and
cruise ship companies have a strong positive correlation: they tend to move
in the same direction under the same circumstances. For example, after the
September 11 terrorist attacks all travel related businesses suffered from
sharply lower demand. A portfolio of two securities with a strong positive
correlation will be the most risky.
Portfolio A is in the middle because we would expect cable TV stocks and
oil stocks to have a weak correlation. A weak correlation (correlation
coefficient of around 0) means that the two securities generally do not move
in the same direction under the same circumstances.
3. How do you calculate a company’s Days Sales Outstanding?
Average Accounts Receivable/ Sales x 365 days
Note: The average accounts receivable for any period can be approximated by:
(Ending accounts receivable + beginning accounts receivable) ÷ 2
4. How do you calculate a company’s Current Ratio?
Current assets (cash, accounts receivable, etc) / Current liabilities (accounts
payable and other short-term liabilities)
A high current ratio indicates that a company has enough cash (and assets
they can quickly turn into cash, like accounts receivable) to cover its
immediate payment requirements on liabilities.

5. Gotham Energy just released second quarter financial results.
Looking at its balance sheet you calculate that it’s Current Ratio went
from 1.5 to 1.2. Does this make you more or less likely to buy the stock?
Less likely. This means that the company is less able to cover its immediate
liabilities with cash on hand and other current assets than it was last quarter.
6. Xeron Software Corporation’s days sales outstanding have gone from
58 days to 42 days. Does this make you more or less likely to issue a Buy
rating on the stock?
More likely. When the company’s days sales outstanding (DSOs) decreases,
it means the company is able to collect money from its customers faster. In
other words, Xeron’s customers went from taking an average of 58 days to
pay their bills to 42 days. All things being equal, having faster paying
customers is almost always a good thing. Of course, one caveat is that you
want to make sure Xeron didn’t achieve this by imposing much tighter credit
terms on its customers and therefore. But if the company’s sales grew at the
same time its DSOs decreased, then as a research analyst or trader you’ll be
more likely to want to buy the stock.




Stock Terminology

Of course, a company's commitment to its stock doesn't end after the
issuance of shares. Companies communicate with shareholders regarding
the firm's past revenues, expenses and profits and the future of the business.
There are also ways a company can manage their shares once the stock is on
the open market to maximize shareholder value, the company's reputation
and the company's future ability to raise funds. Here are several concepts
and terms you'll need to be familiar with when you study stocks and how
public companies manage their shares.
Dividends
Dividends are paid to many shareholders of common stock (and preferred
stock). However, the directors cannot pay any dividends to the common
stock shareholders until they have paid all outstanding dividends to the
preferred stockholders. The incentive for company directors to issue
dividends is that companies in industries that are particularly dividend
sensitive have better market valuations if they regularly issue dividends.
Issuing regular dividends is a signal to the market that the company is doing
well.
Unlike bonds, however, the company directors decide when to pay the
dividend on preferred stock. In contrast, if a company fails to meet bond
payments as scheduled, the bondholders can force the company into Chapter
11 bankruptcy. (Bankruptcy filing in court comes in two categories: Chapter
Vault Guide to Finance Interviews
Stocks
74 © 2005 Vault Inc. C A R E E R
L I B R A R Y
7 and Chapter 11. If a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is approved, the court
puts a stay order on all interest payments – management is given a period of
protection during which it can clean up its financial mess and try to get the
house marching toward profitability. If the management fails to do so within
the given time, there can be a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, when the assets
of the company are liquidated.) This action, in theory, wipes out the value
of the company’s equity.
Stock splits
As a company grows in value, it sometimes splits its stock so that the price
does not become absurdly high. This enables the company to maintain the
liquidity of the stock. If The Coca-Cola Company had never split its stock,
the price of one share bought when the company’s stock was first offered
would be worth millions of dollars. If that were the case, buying and selling
one share would be a very crucial decision. This would adversely affect a
stock’s liquidity (that is, its ability to be freely traded on the market). In
theory, splitting the stock neither creates nor destroys value. However,
splitting the stock is generally received as a positive signal to the market;
therefore, the share price typically rises when a stock split is announced.
Stock buybacks
Often you will hear that a company has announced that it will buy back its
own stock. Such an announcement is usually followed by an increase in the
stock price. Why does a company buy back its stock? And why does its
price increase after?
The reason behind the price increase is fairly complex, and involves three
major reasons. The first has to do with the influence of earnings per share
on market valuation. Many investors believe that if a company buys back
shares, and the number of outstanding shares decreases, the company’s
earnings per share goes up. If the P/E (price to earnings-per-share ratio)
stays stable, investors reason, the price should go up. Thus investors drive
the stock price up in anticipation of increased earnings per share.
The second reason has to do with the signaling effect. This reason is simple
to understand, and largely explains why a company buys back stock. No one
understands the health of the company better than its senior managers. No
one is in a better position to judge what will happen to the future
performance of the company. So if a company decides to buy back stock
(i.e., decides to invest in its own stock), these managers must believe that the
stock price is undervalued and will rise (or so most observers would
Vault Guide to Finance Interviews
Stocks

insider firm profiles, message boards, the Vault Finance Job Board and more. 75 C A R E E R
L I B R A R Y
believe). This is the signal company management sends to the market, and
the market pushes the stock up in anticipation.
The third reason the stock price goes up after a buyback can be understood
in terms of the debt tax shield (a concept used in valuation methods). When
a company buys back stock, its net debt goes up (net debt = debt - cash).
Thus the debt tax shield associated with the company goes up and the
valuation rises (see APV valuation).
New stock issues
The reverse of a stock buyback is when a company issues new stock, which
usually is followed by a drop in the company’s stock price. As with stock
buybacks, there are three main reasons for this movement. First, investors
believe that issuing new shares dilutes earnings. That is, issuing new stock
increases the number of outstanding shares, which decreases earnings per
share, which – given a stable P/E ratio – decreases the share price. (Of
course, the issuing of new stock will presumably be used in a way that will
increase earnings, and thus the earnings per share figure won’t necessarily
decrease, but because investors believe in earnings dilution, they often drive
stock prices down) .
There is also the signaling effect. In other words, investors may ask why the
company’s senior managers decided to issue equity rather than debt to meet
their financing requirements. Surely, investors may believe, management
must believe that the valuation of their stock is high (possibly inflated) and
that by issuing stock they can take advantage of this high price.
Finally, if the company believes that the project for which they need money
will definitely be successful, it would have issued debt, thus keeping all of
the upside of the investment within the firm rather than distributing it away
in the form of additional equity. The stock price also drops because of debt
tax shield reasons. Because cash is flushed into the firm through the sale of
equity, the net debt decreases. As net debt decreases, so does the associated
debt tax shield.

Stocks

Questions
1. What kind of stocks would you issue for a startup?
A startup typically has more risk than a well-established firm. The kind of
stocks that one would issue for a startup would be those that protect the
downside of equity holders while giving them upside. Hence the stock
issued may be a combination of common stock, preferred stock and debt
notes with warrants (options to buy stock).
2. When should a company buy back stock?
When it believes the stock is undervalued, has extra cash, and believes it can
make money by investing in itself. This can happen in a variety of
situations. For example, if a company has suffered some decreased earnings
because of an inherently cyclical industry (such as the semiconductor
industry), and believes its stock price is unjustifiably low, it will buy back
its own stock. On other occasions, a company will buy back its stock if
investors are driving down the price precipitously. In this situation, the
company is attempting to send a signal to the market that it is optimistic that
its falling stock price is not justified. It’s saying: “We know more than
anyone else about our company. We are buying our stock back. Do you
really think our stock price should be this low?”
3. Is the dividend paid on common stock taxable to shareholders?
Preferred stock? Is it tax deductible for the company?
The dividend paid on common stock is taxable on two levels in the U.S.
First, it is taxed at the firm level, as a dividend comes out from the net
income after taxes (i.e., the money has been taxed once already). The
shareholders are then taxed for the dividend as ordinary income (O.I.) on
their personal income tax. Dividend for preferred stock is treated as an
interest expense and is tax-free at the corporate level.
4. When should a company issue stock rather than debt to fund its
operations?
There are several reasons for a company to issue stock rather than debt. If
the company believes its stock price is inflated it can raise money (on very
good terms) by issuing stock. Second, if the projects for which the money
is being raised may not generate predictable cash flows in the immediate
future, it may issue stock. A simple example of this is a startup company.
The owners of startups generally will issue stock rather than take on debt

L I B R A R Y
because their ventures will probably not generate predictable cash flows,
which is needed to make regular debt payments, and also so that the risk of
the venture is diffused among the company’s shareholders. A third reason
for a company to raise money by selling equity is if it wants to change its
debt-to-equity ratio. This ratio in part determines a company’s bond rating.
If a company’s bond rating is poor because it is struggling with large debts,
the company may decide to issue equity to pay down the debt.
5. Why would an investor buy preferred stock?
1) An investor that wants the upside potential of equity but wants to
minimize risk would buy preferred stock. The investor would receive steady
interest-like payments (dividends) from the preferred stock that are more
assured than the dividends from common stock. 2) The preferred stock
owner gets a superior right to the company’s assets should the company go
bankrupt. 3) A corporation would invest in preferred stock because the
dividends on preferred stock are taxed at a lower rate than the interest rates
on bonds.
6. Why would a company distribute its earnings through dividends to
common stockholders?
Regular dividend payments are signals that a company is healthy and
profitable. Also, issuing dividends can attract investors (shareholders).
Finally, a company may distribute earnings to shareholders if it lacks
profitable investment opportunities.
7. What stocks do you like?
This is a question often asked of those applying for all equity (sales &
trading, research, etc.) positions. (Applicants for investment banking and
trading positions, as well as investment management positions, have also
reported receiving this question.) If you’re interviewing for one of these
positions, you should prepare to talk about a couple of stocks you believe are
good buys and some that you don’t. This is also a question asked of
undergraduate finance candidates to gauge their level of interest in finance.
8. What did the S&P 500 close at yesterday?
Another question designed to make sure that a candidate is sincerely
interested in finance. This question (and others like it – “What’s the Dow at
now?” “What’s the yield on the Long Bond?”) can be expected especially of
those looking for sales and trading positions.

9. Why did the stock price of XYZ company decrease yesterday when it
announced increased quarterly earnings?
A couple of possible explanations: 1) the entire market was down, (or the
sector to which XYZ belongs was down), or 2) even though XYZ
announced increased earnings, the Street was expecting earnings to increase
even more.
10. Can you tell me about a recent IPO that you have followed?
Read The Wall Street Journal and stay current with recent offerings.
11. What is your investing strategy?
Different investors have different strategies. Some look for undervalued
stocks, others for stocks with growth potential and yet others for stocks with
steady performance. A strategy could also be focused on the long-term or
short-term, and be more risky or less risky. Whatever your investing
strategy is, you should be able to articulate these attributes.
12. How has your portfolio performed in the last five years?
If you are applying for an investment management firm as an MBA, you’d
better have a good answer for this one. If you don’t have a portfolio, start a
mock one using Yahoo! Finance or other tools. Also, if you think you are
going to say it has outperformed the S&P each year, you better be well
prepared to explain why you think this happened.
13. If you read that a given mutual fund has achieved 50 percent returns
last year, would you invest in it?
You should look for more information, as past performance is not
necessarily an indicator of future results. How has the overall market done?
How did it do in the years before? Why did it give 50 percent returns last
year? Can that strategy be expected to work continuously over the next five
to 10 years? You need to look for answers to these questions before making
a decision.

14. You are on the board of directors of a company and own a significant
chunk of the company. The CEO, in his annual presentation, states that
the company’s stock is doing well, as it has gone up 20 percent in the last
12 months. Is the company’s stock in fact doing well?
Another trick stock question that you should not answer too quickly. First,
ask what the Beta of the company is. (Remember, the Beta represents the
volatility of the stock with respect to the market.) If the Beta is 1 and the
market (i.e. the Dow Jones Industrial Average) has gone up 35 percent, the
company actually has not done too well compared to the broader market.
15. Which do you think has higher growth potential, a stock that is
currently trading at $2 or a stock that is trading at $60?
This question tests your fundamental understanding of a stock’s value. The
short answer to the question is, “It depends.” While at first glance it may
appear that the stock with the lower price has more room for growth, price
does not tell the entire picture. Suppose the $2 stock has 1 billion shares
outstanding. That means it has $2 billion market cap, hardly a small cap
stock. On the flip side, if the $60 stock has 20,000 shares gives it a market
cap of $1,200,000, and hence it is extremely small and is probably seen as
having higher growth potential. Generally, high growth potential has little
to do with a stock's price, and has more to do with it's operations and
revenue prospects.
16. What do you think is happening with ABC stock?
Expect to be asked this question if you say you like to follow a given sector
like technology or pharmaceuticals. Interviewers will test you to see how
well you know your industry. In case you don’t know that stock, admit it,
and offer to describe a stock in that sector that you like or have been
following.
17. Where do you think the DJIA will be in three months and six months
– and why?
Nobody knows the answer to this one. However, you should at least have
some thoughts on the subject and be able to articulate why you take your
stance. If you have been following the performance of major
macroeconomic indicators (which will be reviewed in the next section), you
can state your case well.

18. Why do some stocks rise so much on the first day of trading after
their IPO and others don’t? How is that money left on the table?
By “money left on the table,” bankers mean that the company could have
successfully completed the offering at a higher price, and that the difference
in valuation thus goes to initial investors rather than the company. Why this
happens is not easy to predict from responses received from investors during
roadshows. Moreover, if the stock rises a lot the first day it is good publicity
for the firm. But in many ways it is money left on the table because the
company could have sold the same stock in its initial public offering at a
higher price. However, bankers must honestly value a company and its
stock over the long-term, rather than simply trying to guess what the market
will do. Even if a stock trades up significantly initially, a banker looking at
the long-term would expect the stock to come down, as long as the market
eventually correctly values it.
19. What is insider trading and why is it illegal?
Undergraduates may get this question as feelers of their general knowledge
of the finance industry. Insider trading describes the illegal activity of
buying or selling stock based on information that is not public information.
The law against insider trading exists to prevent those with privileged
information (company execs, I-bankers and lawyers) from using this
information to make a tremendous amount of money unfairly.
20. Who is a more senior creditor, a bondholder or stockholder?
The bondholder is always more senior. Stockholders (including those who
own preferred stock) must wait until bondholders are paid during a
bankruptcy before claiming company assets. 

What are dividends?

Dividends are periodic cash payments distributed to shareholders. Both common and preferred shareholders can receive dividends, but a firm must pay preferred shareholders first before common shareholders can be paid.

What are stock splits?

Stock splits divide a company’s shares into fractions, usually of equal value. This is usually done when the company’s stock price increases significantly. A split ensures that the company’s shares remain affordable and therefore liquid (anyone has the capacity to buy 1 or more shares in the company).

Alternatively, when stock prices drop precipitously to become penny stocks, respectable firms will generally undergo a reverse stock split to stem volatility.

What is a stock buyback/share repurchase?

Stock buybacks are another way for companies to return money to its shareholders by buying back stock in the secondary market. For equity capital markets and equity derivatives you may be expected to know about Normal Course Issuer Bids and Substantial Issuer Bids.

Tell me about a stock in your portfolio.

If you mention that you have a personal portfolio, this may be a question that comes up.

If you are an investor, be prepared to pitch a few stocks, and why you invested in the stocks at the time you did. If you are a trader, be prepare to outline the factors that drive your trading decisions. Short-term investment decisions are generally more appropriate for a trading interview, and will focus on macroeconomic trends and themes.

Pitch me a stock that you would buy or sell now.

A variant of the “pitch me a stock” question, this requires you to pair a stock pitch with current market conditions. You should keep up with current events with the WSJ/Financial Times/Economist.

You need to keep your pitch brief, as traders/salespeople have limited attention spans, the general rule is ~1 minute or less.

You should also be prepared for follow-up questions such as “what is your investment horizon and why?”.

Pitch me three stocks.

This question tests your interest and the depth of your knowledge in the stock market. You should prepare at least 3 stock pitches prior to the interview.

What are 3 significant things that happened in the markets this past week?

Traders are looking for someone intellectually curious who will be engaged with the drivers behind the work. Unlike investment banking which tends to be more regional, markets and products are global and never sleep. No matter where you are in the world, the trading floor is affected by the Federal Reserve, the price of oil and the S&P 500.

As such, the WSJ and Bloomberg are going to be much more relevant than Dealbook. Knowing commodity prices and where the TSX is at is very important when interviewing for a Canadian bank.

Why did the tech bubble burst? Why did the financial crisis happen?

This is rarely asked on the trading floor now as people have short memories, but for nerdier quant groups, this will come up.

Generally, bubbles occur when investor confidence pushes the price of the securities significantly above its fundamental value. The tech bubble is no different. The term “Irrational Exuberance” was coined by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to describe this phenomenon.

The sentiment behind this bubble was that the growth of companies with any online presence or loose relation would be astronomical, but a realisation that normal valuation principles still applied and that many of these companies had no feasible timeline to profit (or even revenue) resulted in markets receding. Literature suggests that a Barron’s article sparked the reversal.

If you had $1 million what would you invest in?

There is no single correct answer to this question. You may want to start with describing your risk tolerance based on your financial position and your expected outlay. Then, based on the current market conditions (stock market, bond market, commodities market), allocate assets based on how far they deviate away from their fundamental levels.

The main thing that the interviewer is looking for is the quality of your thought process and your ability to articulate your ideas.

What if you had to invest that in a single company?

Start the answer the same way you would with the previous question, and transition into a stock pitch. You may need to prepare multiple stock pitches beforehand, see our section on it for more details.

Capital Markets Interview Questions
What is the key difference between a primary market and a secondary market?

Primary markets are where stocks and bonds are issued through investment banks (this includes Initial Public Offerings and Seasoned Equity Offerings).

Secondary markets are where they are subsequently traded by institutions and individuals.

What is a repo?

A repo (repurchase agreement) is a transaction where the seller of a security reaches an agreement to buy the security from the buyer at a later date for a predetermined price. The seller is effectively a lender, loaning the security to the buyer, the borrower.

What is a reverse repo?

A reverse repo is a transaction where the buyer of the security reaches an agreement to sell the security back to the seller at a later date for a predetermined price. As this is simply the other side of a repo transaction, the lending relationship is the same.

If the interest rate in the U.S. increases, how would this affect the USDCAD exchange rate?

The US dollar would strengthen relative to the Canadian dollar, holding all other things constant. Investors will pour into a higher yielding asset assuming no significant delta in risk or expected devaluation.

Empirical evidence suggests that the economy is relatively hotter as well if the central bank is raising rates. Recent Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada actions have supported this.

You may segue into a discussion on purchasing power parity and expectations where you expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate instead, but do not do that.

Should a company issue debt or equity under current market conditions?

The decision is largely influenced by the cost of capital, which is partially determined by stock market conditions and interest rates (remember interest expense is tax deductible). Generally, the company will choose the cheaper financing option (however, there are other factors at play, eg. pecking order theory).

Where do you think the Canadian economy is going next year?

Understanding the current trends in commodity prices (especially oil), unemployment, the stock market, and government policies (fiscal, monetary, foreign etc.) is crucial when answering this question. There is no single correct answer, but speaking articulately on all the relevant points is expected.

What is the current state of interest rates?

You need to know what the interest rates are in Canada and the US, and the consensus on where they’re moving towards. You also need to know who the governor of the Bank of Canada is (Stephen Poloz and his tacky suits), and who the Chair of the Federal Reserve is (Janet Yellen).

You may also be expected to know who the governor of the Bank of England is (Mark Carney) due to London’s relevance in global markets and because he is Canadian. Mario Draghi is the head of the ECB.

What are the objectives of the Federal Reserve?

The main objectives of the Federal Reserve are identified to be “maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates”. The Fed uses various instruments of monetary policy in order to fulfil their mandate. These include:

Open Market Operations
Changing the Overnight Rate
Changing the Reserve Requirements
What is the difference between currency depreciation and devaluation?

Depreciation occurs in a flexible exchange rate system, where the value of the domestic currency decreases relative to foreign currency. Devaluation occurs in a fixed exchange rate system.

What are the different levels of debt (by seniority)?

This is more of a Debt Capital Markets question.

DIP Financing by debtor-in-possession lenders – unique financing method for a company in bankruptcy usually has seniority over all other types of debt
Senior Secured Debt for secured creditors (a lien on fenced off or circled assets) – bank revolvers and bank debt (term loans), certain bonds
High yield bonds – for unsecured creditors
Subordinated debt
Mezzanine – convertibles bond, convertible preferred, preferred, PIK

What is quantitative easing?

Quantitative easing is a monetary policy instrument used by the Fed to depress interest rates. It is achieved through the purchase of securities from the market, and flooding financial institutions with money to give them more incentive to increase lending.

What are non-farm payrolls?

Non-farm is one of the most important days in the economic calendar and refers to all jobs excluding farm workers, sole proprietorships, private household workers, and military and intelligence employees. The above items are stripped out to give a gauge of the economy’s health.

When should a company buy back stock?

When a company has extra cash, and believes its stock is undervalued. Theoretically, if the company believes that it can make a higher return on its stock than its business, it should choose to buy back stock. Stock buybacks can also be used to signal confidence to investors.

This is also an investment banking question.

Is the dividend paid on common stock taxable to shareholders? For the company?

Dividends paid are taxed as investment income to individuals. For the company, dividend paid is not tax deductible as it comes out from net income after taxes.

This implies double taxation, but there are rules in Canada and elsewhere related to dividend gross-ups and other allowances.

Why would an investor prefer preferred stock over common stock?

Preferred stock retains the upside potential of equity while providing a fixed income-like stream of payments to the stockholder
Preferred stock has a more senior claim over assets than common stock
Preferred stock dividends are taxed at a lower rate compared to interest from bonds
Why would a company distribute its earnings to its shareholders via dividends?

Similar to a buyback, continued dividend distribution signals to investors that the company is healthy. By maintaining the dividend, the company can attract shareholders and funds that prefer dividend stocks, thus boosting its stock price.

What did the TSX close at yesterday?

Similar to “What did the S&P 500 close at yesterday?”, this is a question designed to test your interest in finance. It is important to stay up to date with major market indices.

No one really follows the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but have an idea of where it is (if you read the news you will have a general idea of where megacap stocks are going).

Why could the price of a company’s stock increase when it announced decreased quarterly earnings?

There could be several reasons:
1. The entire market/industry is up on the day, masking any downward pressure on the stock
2. The decreased earnings still beat expectations from investors
3. The decreased earnings are a result of a non-recurring expense, and revenues beat expectations
4. Random fluctuations in the market

Fund X has achieved a 50% return last year, should you invest in it?

You need more information. How was the market/S&P 500 last year? How did other funds perform? What is the strategy of Fund X? How did it achieve the 50% return? Generally, past performance does not guarantee future results, and a longer history of outperformance is required to determine whether a fund a truly superior to its peers.

Which stock has a higher growth potential: Stock A at $5 or Stock B at $50?

It depends. While you might be tempted to answer stock A, the stock price has little to do with a company’s growth potential. Stock A may have a lower price, but that does not necessarily mean it is a smaller, faster growing company. You will need more information about the companies’ operations and revenues.

Why do some stocks pop on the first day of trading after IPO?

Sometimes, companies will complete their offering at a price lower than what the market values the company at. Effectively, the company leaves money on the table, where the difference in the IPO price and the market price (after correction) is captured by the initial shareholders rather than the company. This can be good for the company, as it A) is good publicity, B) appeases initial shareholders and C) makes it easier for the company to raise cash in the future.

What is insider trading?

Insider trading is the buying and selling of securities with material non-public information. As a trader, you may come across information on companies that is not yet public (mergers, FDA approval on a drug etc.). You cannot trade on that information until the company publicly discloses it.

Who is a more senior creditor, a bondholder or a stockholder?

Bonds are always more senior than stocks. This means in event of bankruptcy, before stockholders can claim company assets, bondholders will be paid out first.

Fixed Income Questions
What is par value?

Par value, or face value of the bond, is the amount that the bond issuer will pay the bondholder at its expiry.

What are coupon payments?

Coupon payments are periodic interest payments that the bond issuer will pay the bondholder.

What is bond price?

Bond price is the price that the market is willing to pay the issuer to holder the bond. Bond price depends on its coupon rate, embedded options, default risk, interest rates, and many other factors.

What is default risk?

Default risk, or credit risk, is the risk that the bond issuer will go bankrupt, and cannot pay the full amount owed to its bondholders.

What is default premium?

Default premium is the difference between the yield of a bond and the yield of an identical risk-free bond. The default premium compensates for the issuer’s default risk.

What is credit rating?

Credit rating is given to companies and governments by credit rating agencies (S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, DBRS). The ratings affect borrowing rates and their ability to raise money.

What are the 2 categories of bonds when categorized by credit quality?

Investment Grade Bonds – Bonds of high credit rating
High Yield Bonds – Bonds of lower credit rating, also known as Junk Bonds
What is PIK?

PIK stands for Paid In Kind, which refers to bonds that are paid by more bonds as opposed to cash.

What are Govies?

Govies are bonds issued by the federal government to support spending. They are the least risky fixed income security, as federal government have the lowest risk of default. They are used as benchmarks for other fixed income securities for pricing.

What are Munis?

Munis are bonds issued by the municipal or state/provincial government (in Canada, Provincial bonds or Provies trade under completely different dynamics than the robust US muni market, as Provies are widely seen to be implicitly guaranteed by the Federal Canadian government).

These bonds are different in that they are generally tax exempt, which means the attractiveness of Munis is a function of the properties of the bond itself and your individual tax bracket. If you are interviewing with a US bank, you will need to know about tax-exempt yields.

Munis do have default risk, as illustrated by the unprecedented recent example of Detroit. That bankruptcy also meant that bond investors had to consider their effective seniority against pensioners and other stakeholders that they ended up ceding haircuts to – influencing the rates lenders are willing to take going forward.

An interesting development going forward will be the City of Chicago – a far more important city globally, and one that has been recently downgraded to Junk by Moody’s.

What are Corporate Bonds?

Corporate bonds are issued by corporates to finance projects or working capital. Corporate bonds can be split into investment grade bonds, or high yield bonds (sometimes called junk bonds), depending on the corporation’s risk of default.

How are bonds priced?
Bonds are priced by discounting all the future cash flows expected from the bond, by a risk adjusted rate.

What are the key differences between a stock and a bond?

A stock represents ownership of a company’s assets after senior claimholders (eg. bond holders). A bond generally has a fixed maturity and pays a specific interest, while stock holders have a residual claim on the earnings of a company after interest expense, and can be paid a dividend. Stock holders typically have voting rights, while bond holders do not.

What is duration?

Duration is the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rate, measured in years. Typically, duration is related to maturity in that longer maturing bonds have higher duration.

What is convexity?

Convexity is the sensitivity of a bond’s duration to changes in interest rate. As the relationship between a bond’s price and interest rate is non-linear, it describes how convex the curve is.

What is the yield curve?

A yield curve graphs the relationship between the interest rates and maturities of bonds of the same credit quality. The slope of the yield curve, generally classified into “rising”, “steep” or “inverted”, may be indicative of investor sentiment on the economy. A typical yield curve is rising, with lower short-term interest rates and higher long-term interest rates.

If you believe the interest rate is about to rise, what will happen to the price of bonds?

Generally, bond prices are inversely related to the interest rate, meaning as interest rate rises, the bond price falls.

What is the value of a zero-coupon perpetuity?

Zero.

What is a basis point?

A basis point is one one hundredth of a percent, it is usually used within the context of fixed income.

Why might two bonds issued by the same company with the same coupon/maturity be trading at different prices?

Embedded options could be a reason for the price difference. Investors are willing to pay more for a putable bond (embedded with a put option) as it protects their downside if interest rates rise. Conversely, investors demand a discount for callable bonds (embedded with a call option), as the issuer has an option to buy back the bond if interest rates plummet.

What are the limits of duration?

Duration can be useful as a measure of price volatility. However, it is limited in that:

Duration does not take in account of convexity, and is only valid when the changes in interest rates are small (where convexity plays a smaller role)
Duration assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve, so any steepening/flattening of the yield curve reduces the accuracy of duration
Duration does not take in account of embedded options such as calls and puts
Which bond has a greater duration: a treasury bond or a junk bond with the same maturity?

The treasury bond has a greater duration, as it carries a lower coupon rate compared to the junk bond.

What is the duration of a zero coupon bond?

As a zero coupon bond has no coupon payments, the duration of a zero coupon bond is simply equal to its maturity. A 10-year zero coupon bond has a maturity and duration of 10 years, while the same conventional bond has a duration of less than 10 years.

There are 2 bonds of similar maturity and coupon, bond A and bond B. Which one should you buy if bond A trades under the yield curve, while bond B trade above the yield curve?

As price is inversely related to yield, Bond B would be trading at a lower price, therefore you should buy Bond B.

Describe the convexity of a callable bond

Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at lower yields. Convexity is the rate of change of a bond’s duration. As interest rates approach the yield-to-call, the rate of change slows.

A callable bond benefits the bond issuer as it can call or redeem the bond at the issuer’s option for a certain price.

Usually, this happens when interest rates fall and the borrower would benefit from redeeming and reissuing the bond at a lower interest rate. As such, as interest rates fall, the best possible price the bond investor can achieve is the call price.

As a follow up question, an interviewee may be asked about yield to call or how investors need to be compensated for this embedded option (they will need a higher coupon).

Why do yield curves invert?

An inverted yield curve describes a yield curve which slopes downward. It is relatively rare as typically, cost of borrowing increases as maturity increases. Yield curves invert when the market expects short-term interest rates to decline, which tends to occur following periods of tight money/credit.

How can you make money if you expect an inverted yield curve to revert?

A reversion of an inverted yield curve is in essence a steepening of the yield curve, where the slope goes from negative to positive. You would want to put on a curve-steepening trade, where you can buy long-term maturities or short short-term maturities.

How can you make money if you expect a normal yield curve to invert?

You would want to put on a curve-flattening trade, where you can buy short-term maturities or short long-term maturities.

How is bond price related to its yield?

There is an inverse relationship between a bond’s price and its yield. If bond’s price falls, its yield rises.

How would you value a perpetual bond that pays $500 a year?

As there is no lump sum payment at the end, the value of the bond is simply the coupon divided by a risk adjusted rate.

What are the major factors that affect the yield on a corporate bond?

Interest rates and credit risk. The yield is a combination of the interest rate on a US Treasury bond with similar maturity and a risk premium associated with the company.

If interest rates are expected to rise, should you buy a 10 year coupon bond or a 10 year zero coupon bond?

The 10 year coupon bond. Remember the price of the bond is inversely related to interest rates. A zero coupon bond is more sensitive to interest rate changes, therefore its price will fall more if interest rate increases.

Which is less risky: a 10 year coupon bond or a 10 year zero coupon bond?

A 10 year coupon bond is less risky, as you are receiving cash in the form of coupon payments. In event of a default before maturity, you have at least received some money back, as opposed to a zero coupon bond. In addition, the price of coupon bonds is less sensitive to changes in interest rates, therefore you lose less if interest rates rise.

If you believe interest rates will fall, should you buy bonds or sell bonds?

You should buy bonds, as bond prices rise when interest rates fall. The caveat is if the market also believes that interest rates will fall, it may have already priced it in. You should only buy bonds if you believe interest rates will fall more than the market’s expectations.

How does inflation hurt creditors?

Creditors lend money at a fixed rate, and inflation cuts into the returns for creditors. If you are lending out money at 5%, and cost of goods is rising at 2%, you are only really clearing 3%.

If the stock market falls, what might happen to bond prices?

You may expect bond prices to increase.

What is Yield to Maturity?

Yield to Maturity, or YTM, is the yield realized by holding the bond to its maturity.

What is an interest rate collar?

An interest rate collar is the simultaneous sale of an interest rate floor and purchase of an interest rate ceiling or cap. Collars are used by fixed income investors to lock in a range of interest rates, which allows for them to be protected from rising rates while giving up the potential benefits of lower interest rates (remember for bonds, lower interest rates means a higher present value of cash flows and vice versa).

The interest rate cap and interest rate floor must both have the same notional principal (the dollar amount to which the contracted terms are relevant to), and the ceiling/cap must be above the floor strike.

The interviewer can subsequently ask about reverse collars or zero cost collars.

Derivatives Questions
What is a call option?

Call option gives the option holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the strike price before its expiration.

What is a put option?

Put option gives the option holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at the strike price before its expiration.

What is a forward contract?

A forward contract is an agreement between two parties, where one party agrees to deliver an asset to the other at an agreed upon price and date. For example, a coal miner can enter into a forward with a power plant, where both sides protect themselves from the price volatility of the underlying asset (in this case coal).

What is a future contract?

A future contract is a standardized forward that trades on an exchange. In return for decreased flexibility, futures provide greater liquidity to the contract holders.

What is put call parity?

Put call parity defines the relationship between a European put option and a European call option. Specifically, a put option with the underlying security gives you the same payoff diagram as a call option with a bond. From this relationship, we get the following formula:

P + S = C + B

P – Put option at the strike price X

S – Underlying security

C – Call option at the strike price X

B – Risk free bond that pays the strike price at the expiration

What is the delta of an at-the-money option?

Delta is the ratio of the change in the price of the option per unit change in the price of the underlying security. When the option is at-the-money, the strike price of the option equals to the price of the underlying security. Assuming the price of the security is equally likely to go up or go down, the delta is 0.5.

Does principal get exchanged in a foreign currency swap?

Unlike interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps do require an exchange of principal at the outset and the maturity of the swap.

What causes swap spreads to widen or narrow?

The swap spread is the difference between the negotiated and the fixed rate in an interest rate swap. When interest rates are expected to rise, paying fixed and receiving floating becomes more desirable, and the difference between the two widens. The opposite is true for when interest rates are expected to fall.

Describe the convexity of a Mortgage Backed Security

Convexity is negative – once interest rates fall, homeowners will prepay their mortgages, reducing the principal of the investment.

What is a simple option strategy if you expect a swing in price but are not sure on direction?

A straddle (buying a put and call with the same strike or exercise price and expiration date) is best in this situation. This question is somewhat misleading as an investor would only enter into this straddle if they felt that the implied change in price would be much larger than the premiums paid, so if the swing was not large enough this may not be a good strategy.

What has higher absolute rho, a straight bond or an in-the-money convertible?

Straight bond – interest rates go up, bond falls
Convertible – interest rates go up, and value of call increases so the bond has a higher rho
When would you write a call option on a stock?

When you expect the price of the stock to fall. A call option is a bet on the price of a stock to rise, writing the option is taking the other side of that bet, where the profit is the option premium.

When would you buy a put option on a stock?

Similar to writing a call option, when you expect the price of the stock to fall.

How does a swap work?

A swap exchanges future cash flows (and risk) between the participating parties. Common forms of swaps include interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and credit default swaps.

What is at the money? In the money? Out of the money?

They are terms used to describe the state of the option, namely whether or not the option is worth exercising at the current price of the underlying asset. For call options, when the asset price is above the strike price of the option, the option is in the money. When the asset price is below the strike price, the option is out of the money. For put options, this relationship is simply flipped. For both call options and put options, when the asset price equals the strike price, the option is at the money.

If you are holding a call option on CIBC stock with a strike price of $120 (expiring today), and the stock is currently trading at $100, how much is your option worth? Is it in the money or out of the money?

The option is worth $0, as exercising the option would allow you to buy CIBC stock at $120, and the stock is currently trading at $100. You would incur a loss of $20 if you exercise, therefore you would rather let the option expire. The option is currently out of the money.

Which would be more valuable: a call option on Facebook or a call option on Walmart? (Assuming all else is equal)

A call option on Facebook is more valuable. You need to recognize that an option’s value is partially driven by the price volatility of the underlying asset, as high volatility increases the chance of the option being in the money at some point before expiration.

Which would be more valuable: a January put option on Suncor or a February put option on Suncor? (Assuming all else is equal)

The February put option. An option’s value is also driven by the expiration date of the option, as options with longer expiries have more chances for the option to be in the money.

When would a trader seek to profit from shorting futures?

The trader in the short position believes that the asset price will decrease (below market expectations).

How do interest rates affect the price of options?

Call options: higher interest rates increase value
Put options: higher interest rates decrease value
What is the difference between futures and forwards?

Futures are standardized and traded on exchanges, while forwards are more flexible and traded over-the-counter (OTC).

What is a mortgage backed security?

A mortgage backed security (MBS) is an asset backed security (ABS) secured by mortgages.

To understand why this is a relevant product, an investor looks at the value of a standalone mortgage versus a pooled mortgage trust. If an investor has one individual mortgage, the standalone default or prepayment risk is high. If there are thousands of mortgages, the defaults will blend into an effective interest rate on the MBS.

Mortgages themselves are an illiquid security. Packaging mortgages through securitization provides a liquid product with a higher yield (although less than the yield of an individual mortgage). Usually, MBS are overcollateralized (secured by a greater notional amount of mortgage loans than the principal on the security) to enhance the security. Investment banks will take a cut/fee in structuring the MBS.

Economics Questions
What goes into GDP?

Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditure + Exports – Imports
or C + I + G + Net Exports

How would a Presidential impeachment affect interest rates?

Generally, political instability will lead to fears that the economy will go into recession, and the Federal Reserve (or Bank of Canada) combat those fears with monetary expansion (lowering interest rates or injecting money into the economy).

How does the government combat inflation or hyperinflation?

The government has fiscal and monetary tools to maintain a stable long term inflation rate. Fiscal policies involve taxes and government spending, while monetary policies involve interest rate changes, reserve requirement changes, and open market operations. In event of higher than expected inflation, the government increase tax, reduce spending, increase interest rates or increase reserve requirements to slow down growth in the economy.

If unemployment is low, what happens to inflation and interest rates?

Low unemployment means high level of economic activity, therefore inflation and interest rates both go up.

Do you think the Bank of Canada will cut or raise interest rate over the next year?

You should have an understanding of why the prior interest rate cuts/raises were done, and the market’s consensus on what the Bank of Canada will do next.

If Canadian dollar weakens, what will happen to interest rates?

Generally, interest rates will rise as a weaker currency drives inflation through higher prices on imported goods.

If inflation rates rise, what will happen to the Canadian dollar?

It will weaken.

If interest rates in Japan decreases relative to interest rates in Canada, what will happen to the Yen and the Canadian dollar?

The Yen will weaken relative to the Loonie/Canadian Dollar.

If inflation rates in the UK rise relative to inflation rates in Canada, what will happen to the Pound and the Canadian dollar?

The Loonie will strengthen relative to the Pound.

What is the difference between currency depreciation and devaluation?

Depreciation occurs when a country allows its currency to lose value in the currency markets, while devaluation occurs in fixed exchange rate systems.

What happens to big Canadian multinationals when Canadian dollar weakens?

Canadian multinationals that rely on export will see its sales/earnings increase as Canadian dollar weakens.

What factors affect exchange rates?

Interest rates and interest rate expectations
Inflation and inflation expectations
Capital market equilibrium
